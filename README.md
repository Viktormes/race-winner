# Race Winner
This is a test for a job application. 
I am creating a program that is reading a text file with comma separated lines that includes a name of a person, an ID, start time, goal time and race type. 
This program will be based on that text file, return a (or multiple) winner(s).

Since I am doing this alone and in a very short time, I decided to not create issues or branches in this project.

# Running the application
To get information on how to run the application, please go to the [wiki](https://github.com/Viktormes/race-winner/wiki) page.
